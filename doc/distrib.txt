# The example code

⋆Download from GitHub⋆ https://github.com/ds26gte/lfelessons the
source for this document and the example code. This 
produces a directory `lfelessons` with the following tree
structure:

```
lfelessons
├── manifest
├── makefile
├── doc
│   ├── index.txt
│   ├── title.txt
│   ├── intro.txt
│   └── ...
└── src
    ├── montyhall.lfe
    ├── montecarlo.lfe
    ├── guess.lfe
    └── ...
````

`doc` contains the sources for this document.  `src`
contains the example code.  There is also a `makefile` which
may be called with various arguments:

• `make html` makes the HTML version of the document. 

• `make beam` compiles the example LFE module files in `src` into a
subdirectory called `ebin`.  If you have unpacked
`lfelessons` in a directory under `ERL_LIBS`, you may access
the compiled modules without qualification.

• `make test` runs tests on the example modules.

• `make dist` makes a tarball out of the directory.

• `make clean` removes all the created files (compiled
modules, HTML, auxiliary files).
